# Configuration file for Circle CI 
# CI will report failure if any executed command returns and error status
# Operations performed are as follows
# Build source code
# Run unit tests for C++ 
# Run static code analyzer for SourceCloud
# Upload test results
# Every run command should start with source ${INIT_ENV} to ensure all default dependancies are available
